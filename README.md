# README
Only works with temp website for now which is: 
Go to  https://5afd-86-97-71-232.ngrok-free.app  for the scrapper. 
This web scrapper scrapes all the products off of the skincare section
of sephora. 

If website is down, then download the files and run 'npm run start' on your local host 8000 (or choose whatever terminal you want) in the terminal

 Add /products at the end of the url to see all the products
 add /products/brandID to see a specific brand. For example, replare brandID with sephora
 
 (use a JSON viewer extension for a better results)
