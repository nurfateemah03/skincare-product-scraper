# Sephora Skincare Scraper
This project is a web scraper that retrieves data from the skincare section of Sephora's website. It allows you to fetch all the products or filter them by brand.

# Temporary Website
For now, the scraper is hosted on a temporary website. You can access it by visiting https://5afd-86-97-71-232.ngrok-free.app. Please note that this website may not always be available or may have limited uptime.

# Usage
If the temporary website is down or you prefer to run the scraper locally, you can follow these steps:

Download the project files.
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Install the dependencies by running npm install.
Start the scraper by running npm run start. It will run on your local host on port 8000 by default, but you can choose a different host if desired.
Open a web browser and access the scraper using the URL http://localhost:8000/products to see all the products or http://localhost:8000/products/brandID to see products from a specific brand. Replace brandID with the desired brand (e.g., "sephora").
For a better viewing experience, you can use a JSON viewer extension in your browser to format the results.
